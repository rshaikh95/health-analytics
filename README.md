This assignment is a primer for 504/507

For this primer, I have imported pandas and numpy as pd and np.

I have created the following variables: number variable, string variable, list and dictionary.

Number Variable: num, num2

String Variable: str, str2

List: my_list, my_list2

Dictionary: dict (contains string, list and nested dictionary)

I have also created a function with two inputs called Cholesterol. 
This check LDL and HDL levels to see if heart is healthy or not using an if/else statement. 

All the variables used and function calculated were printed with the values at the end.
